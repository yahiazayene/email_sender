Welcome to my Email Sender App! This application allows you to effortlessly send emails
multiple times and even enables you to upload files directly into the email body.

This app leverages Eel to seamlessly integrate HTML, JavaScript, and Python
ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. 

to open it just double click on app.py 

1-App Password Setup:

-For enhanced security, use an App Password instead of your actual email password.
-Enable two-factor authentication for your email account.
-Generate an App Password and use it as the password when configuring your email in the app.

-With this setup, you can send emails using this application. 
-If you don't follow this step and use your actual email password, it will not work.

2-File Path Verification:

-When selecting a file for upload, manually copy and paste the file path into the designated "File Path" field.
-This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to your local file system.
